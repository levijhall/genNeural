# genNeural
Generalized artificial neural network using arbitrary graphs

Expanding on projects from university courses, genNeural allows the user to produce arbitrary neural network structures by specifying the structure of a vertex-edge graph, defining activation functions per vertex, and indicating input and output neurons in the graph.

This approach is not GPU optimized, but allows for rapid prototyping of potential structures to improve learning by allowing the manipulation on a vertex-to-vertex or edge-to-edge (as directional edges) basis.
